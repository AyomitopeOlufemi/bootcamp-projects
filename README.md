# Bootcamp Projects  

This repository contains my bootcamp project documents and learnings. During the program, I gained hands-on experience in **cloud security** by working on real-world tasks within AWS. I learned how to deploy and secure AWS resources (EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, CloudFront), configure secure networking with VPCs and security groups, and monitor infrastructure using CloudWatch.  

The bootcamp strengthened my ability to design and implement secure cloud environments, preparing me for roles such as **Cloud Security Engineer**. My focus is on building and protecting cloud infrastructures while applying security best practices across AWS services.
